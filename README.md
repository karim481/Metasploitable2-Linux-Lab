# Metasploitable2-Linux-Lab

## Objective

The Metasploitable2-Linux project aimed to create a vulnerable testing environment for practicing penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. The primary focus was to identify and exploit various security vulnerabilities within the system, gaining hands-on experience with real-world attack scenarios. This practical approach was designed to deepen understanding of system security, exploit development, and defensive measures.

### Skills Learned

- Comprehensive understanding of common vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.
- Proficiency in using penetration testing tools and frameworks.
- Ability to identify and exploit security weaknesses in systems and applications.
- Enhanced knowledge of Linux operating systems and network security principles.
- Development of problem-solving and analytical skills in a cybersecurity context.

### Tools Used

- Metasploit Framework for exploiting vulnerabilities.
- Nmap and Rustscan for network scanning and enumeration.
- SearchSploit for searching and filtering exploits and shellcodes from Exploit-DB

## Vulnerability Analysis

Each vulnerability identified and exploited in this project is detailed in its respective folder. The analysis includes step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and explanations for each vulnerability.
Every screenshot should have some text explaining what the screenshot is about.
